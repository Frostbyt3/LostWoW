## Introduction


LostWoW (LostCore) is a **_MMORPG_** Framework based mostly in C++.

It is derived from *MaNGOS*, the *Massive Network Game Object Server*, and is
based on the code from that project with extensive changes over time to optimize,
improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the in-game
mechinics and functionality.

LostWoW Comes with a series of modifications and improvements over the *MaNGOS* and *TrinityCore* Frameworks.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.
